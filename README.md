# Mappr

Mappr is a Geographical Information System (GIS) program which will display a given location's geography. In the following, I'll give updates on the steps I took to create Mappr. 


Step 1:
Building Mappr using Python. I first downloaded the GeoJSON file from a website called BBBike, and using Python to load the file, process the data, and display Roads, Buildings and Parks on a Tkinter window.  
This is what it looks like as of now:
